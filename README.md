# This is Dave's Cool book app

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

# Currently there are only 3 endpoints:
## 1. Home
`/ - This is the endpoint`

## 2. New Books
`/deck2 - This is the endpoint`

## 3. Old Books
`/deck - This is the endpoint`

### Hope you enjoy looking at my basic app.
